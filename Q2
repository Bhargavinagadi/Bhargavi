//Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. This means the signal handler (receiver) executes within the same thread that triggered the signal.
//Step 1: Define the Signal (in signals.py):
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def check_thread(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"üö® Signal running in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

Step 2: Trigger the Signal (in Django shell or a view)

import threading
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

print(f"‚è≥ Caller running in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
User.objects.create(username="testuser")
