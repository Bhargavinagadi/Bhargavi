//Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. If the database transaction is rolled back, any changes made by the signal handler are also rolled back.
//Step 1: Define the Signal (in signals.py):
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import transaction

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(" Signal triggered. Creating profile...")
    # Artificially raise an exception to force rollback
    raise Exception("Simulating an error to rollback the transaction.")

//Step 2: Trigger the Signal (in Django shell or view):
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import transaction

try:
    with transaction.atomic():
        print(" Creating user...")
        User.objects.create(username="testuser")
except Exception as e:
    print(f" Transaction rolled back: {e}")

print(" Check if user was created.")

//Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller by default.

If the transaction is rolled back due to an error in the signal handler, all database changes are rolled back.

To run signals outside the transaction, you must explicitly handle it (e.g., using transaction.on_commit).
